PE1 2.5: Python Comments
Objective: Practice using comments, docstrings, and TODO notes in Python.

This program calculates the miles per gallon (mpg) of a car.
It demonstrates the use of single-line comments, inline comments,
and a special TODO comment for future improvements.
"""

# Define the tank size in gallons
tank_size = 15  

# Define the total distance covered in miles
distance = 600  

# Calculate miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
mpg = distance / tank_size  # Formula: distance รท fuel used

# Print the result of the mpg calculation
print("Miles per gallon:", mpg)

# TODO: Update this program to ask the user for tank size and distance
