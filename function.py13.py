# function to calculate the area of a square
def square(side):
    area = side * side
    print("The area of the square is", area, "square units.")

# function to calculate the area of a circle
def circle(radius):
    pi = 3.14
    area = pi * radius * radius
    print("The area of the circle is", area, "square units.")
